# PORTFOLIO

This repository serves as a destination for projects I worked on in Data Analytics, Financial Risk/Investment Analysis, and Business Intelligence.

These are projects I worked on as part of my duties in previous positions (recreated with dummy data) or using publicly available datasets.

## About Me

I am proficient in Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau, with hands-on experience building insightful dashboards, automating data workflows, and performing complex data analysis. Currently, I am expanding my skill set by learning Python to enhance my capabilities in data manipulation, statistical analysis, and later on, machine learning.

## Navigation

Each project is organized in its own folder with:
- A detailed `README.md` explaining the project background, data sources, further insights.
- A folder called `project.files` which includes downloadable source files, Power BI dashboards (`.pbix`), Tableau workbooks, SQL scripts, and Python notebooks (where applicable).
- Screenshots and visualizations to provide a quick glance at the outcomes.
